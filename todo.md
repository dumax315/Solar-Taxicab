TODO:

randomize position of planets

using experimental branch management

and also the .pedit sprites for the different ship sizes
i'll do a couple stages for now
i'm also going to make each ship have a flame frame animation

unlockable planets yield more profit

group passengers in menu into
passenger * X

BUGS:

ship doesn't rotate when pointer is close to 180degrees from the direction of travel

DONE:

right now im making the .pedit sprites in grayscale for the:
- planets: 3 different planets, transformations of rotation and scale can be done afterward
- cargo/people
